# The HITCH Project: Database Management System Website

This project, named "The HITCH Project," implements a web-based application using HTML, PHP, CSS, and MySQL to manage data. It leverages XAMPP as the local development environment. The application features separate admin and user interfaces, enabling distinct functionalities for each role.

# Description

The HITCH Project provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with a database. Users can potentially view, create, update, or delete data (depending on their roles and permissions).

# Features

Database Management: The project establishes a connection to a MySQL database and facilitates data manipulation through the web interface.
Separate User Roles: Admin and user pages cater to different functionalities, enhancing security and control over data access.
Web-Based Interface: The application is accessible through a web browser, making it user-friendly and platform-independent (within supported browsers).
Developed with XAMPP: XAMPP serves as the local development environment, integrating Apache web server, MySQL database server, PHP interpreter, and Perl interpreter for convenient development and testing.
